## 5. üßπ Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Check for nulls
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
      gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
      quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Delete nulls
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
      gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
      quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
